# RonnieColemanFitnessTrainer
These are the files associated with a hack-a-thon project completed in Fall of 2019.

The goal of this project was to create a fitness trainer app that tracks your heart rate and when it falls below a certain limit, it plays motivational audio clips from a bodybuilder named Ronnie Coleman.

This was completed as a group project along with [Cole Beck](https://github.com/clb0119), [Austin Bush](https://github.com/AustinBush32), and [Brenden O'Keefe](https://github.com/bzo0013).
